"""
Classification of all hyperbolic Coxeter groups

A-Type graphs are cycles

B-Type graphs are represented as a line with a branch making it look like a "Y"

E-Type graphs are represented as a line with a branch making it look like a "T"

J-Type graphs has all nodes connected to each others

S-Type graphs looks like squares

L-Type graphs is just a straight line with no branches
